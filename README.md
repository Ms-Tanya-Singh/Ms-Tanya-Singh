##  Creative Side

In addition to coding, I'm a dabbler of poetry, where verses breath in the backrop (my designed) aesthetics and captures hope, fragility, dignity and the beauty of living the gift of life as a woman. I believe that the best work often happens at the intersection of logic and feeling.
